  "SungearEngine", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SungearEngine"

    SungearEngineConfig.cmake
    sungearengine-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SungearEngine" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SungearEngine_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SungearEngine" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
